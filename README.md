## App Description
Dessert Clicker is a app to help us understand activity lifecycle and configuration changes

* **Codelab: 7) Practice: Add a ViewModel to Dessert Clicker**
  * This is a Practice Codelab

## Solution in github
* Codelab: 2) Branch main
  * https://github.com/google-developer-training/basic-android-kotlin-compose-training-dessert-clicker/tree/main
* Codelab: 7) Branch viewmodel
  * https://github.com/google-developer-training/basic-android-kotlin-compose-training-dessert-clicker/tree/viewmodel

## Objective
* Codelab: 2)
  * Log information to the Logcat
  * View Logs with Logcat
  * How to override lifecycle callback methods to perform operations at different times in the activity lifecycle
